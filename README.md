# Project-2-songs
This was my second project for General Assembly and it as an app to track your favorite songs. Users are able to post their favorite song and are also able to comment on the songs they posted as well as other songs on the site. This app offers full CRUD functionality but most features are only availabe when a user is signed in through Googles OAuth.
